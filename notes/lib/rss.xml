Turbulence is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM) [1]. It organizes the ISM structure to optimize and direct energy fluxes across an enormous range of length scales within the Milky Way disk. Interstellar turbulence, however, differs from the familiar Kolmogorov homogeneous and isotropic incompressible case [2, 3] in several important respects: it is neither isotropic nor homogeneous [4]; the interstellar gas is highly compressible and magnetized; and its thermal energy is not strictly conserved. Instead, the ISM-specific radiative cooling and volumetric heating functions determine an equilibrium multiphase nature of the neutral ISM [5, 6, 7]. Nonlinear advection couples with nonlinear radiative cooling, further complicating the treatment of the ISM. We hence deal with a classical example of a hierarchical nonequilibrium dissipative system, receiving energy primarily at large scales (∼ 100 pc) from stellar feedback, extragalactic gas accretion, large-scale shear, and gravitational instabilities within the disk and loosing energy through small-scale dissipation (10−4 pc) and local radiative cooling [8].

According to the second law of thermodynamics the total entropy of the universe never decreases; it either stays constant or increases. An increase in entropy is always related to a deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium. It turns out that any entropy production in the various known processes in the universe is totally insignificant compared to the total entropy of the universe56, which is huge, and dominated by the relativistic species. Thus it is an excellent approximation to treat the expansion of the universe as adiabatic, so that the total entropy stays constant, i.e.<br>

In statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods comprise a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The more steps that are included, the more closely the distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution. Various algorithms exist for constructing chains, including the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/yApmR-c_hKU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/yApmR-c_hKU</a><br>

Every non-leaf node can be thought of as implicitly generating a splitting hyperplane that divides the space into two parts, known as half-spaces. Points to the left of this hyperplane are represented by the left subtree of that node and points to the right of the hyperplane are represented by the right subtree. The hyperplane direction is chosen in the following way: every node in the tree is associated with one of the k dimensions, with the hyperplane perpendicular to that dimension's axis. So, for example, if for a particular split the "x" axis is chosen, all points in the subtree with a smaller "x" value than the node will appear in the left subtree and all points with a larger "x" value will be in the right subtree. In such a case, the hyperplane would be set by the x value of the point, and its normal would be the unit x-axis.

where  is the time ordering operator: "the product(s) of operators to its right is to be ordered, not as written, but with operators at later times to the left of those at earlier times" (Srednicki, p. 45).

This typically occurs when a system is in contact with an outside thermal reservoir, and a change in the system occurs slowly enough to allow the system to be continuously adjusted to the temperature of the reservoir through heat exchange (see quasi-equilibrium). In contrast, an adiabatic process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings (Q = 0).<br>In an isothermal process,<br><br><br>In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process (Greek: adiábatos, "impassable") is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat or mass between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. As a key concept in thermodynamics, the adiabatic process supports the theory that explains the first law of thermodynamics.<br>Some processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient "adiabatic approximation".<br><br>In an adiabatic process,<br>
